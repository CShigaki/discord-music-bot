## Why
It looks like youtube doesn't like people streaming their stuff and they kept disconnecting me and interrupting the streaming.

This folder is a workaround to avoid that. Instead of streaming from youtube, we:

- Download the file and save them to this folder
- Stream the file to discord from this folder
- Delete the file right after the audio player enters the idle state

It's shitty but it works ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
